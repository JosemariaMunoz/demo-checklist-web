demochecklist.caption=Here's your Demo-Server Checklist result
fix-it=Fix it
inconsistencies-in-demo-configuration=You could optimize your demo configuration
javax.portlet.title.com_liferay_sales_checklist_DemoChecklistPortlet=DemoChecklist
message-analytics-cloud=Analytics Cloud connection looks ok, or it doesn't exist. But this feature hasn't been tested yet, it might be completely wrong. Better check manually yourself.
message-index=It looks like this instance has a working full text index. Found {0} users in index.
message-login-prepopulate=The login dialog's user name is not pre-filled with a domain name. An empty field helps Password Managers to fill in data for you.
message-password-policy-change-required=The default password policy allows administrators to change passwords without requiring the users to reset them again upon their first login. That's an appropriate Demo Security Level for Ease of Use.
message-session-extension=It looks like the session is extended as long as the browser is open - great for demos
message-strangers-can-create-accounts=Anonymous users can't create accounts on their own. Typically the expected situation in a demo.
message-virtualhost=It looks like This instance is accessed with its known virtual host name {1}
missing-analytics-cloud=Analytics Cloud connection does not look good due to {0}. But note: This checklist-feature hasn't been properly tested yet, this alarm could be a false-positive.
missing-failed-checklist-item=One of the Checklist items couldn't be retrieved due to {0}
missing-index=This instance looks like it's lacking a complete full text index (There's no index in DXPC's backup). Found {0} users in index.
missing-login-prepopulate=The login-dialog's user name is pre-filled with a domain name. Bad for using Password Managers. See portal.properties entry {0}
missing-password-policy-change-required=The default password policy requires users to set a new password once an administrator has changed it. In demos, this is an extra step, and typically an administrator is impersonating the users anyway.
missing-session-extension=It looks like the session times out... See portal.properties entry {0}
missing-strangers-can-create-accounts=It looks like anonymous users can create an account for themselves. Check portal.properties entry {0}
missing-virtualhost=This instance is accessed as {0}, but configured as {1} - consider changing the virtual host name
